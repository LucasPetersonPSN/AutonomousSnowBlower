<h1>Autonomous Snowblower</h1>

<h2>Webapp Tasks, priority denoted by 1,2,3:</h2>

- (2) Change the buttons to a field similar to a joystick
- (1) Create "admin screen" - revealed by tapping on certain areas of the screen in some sequence . This screen will have a stream of the console, be able to restart the webapp (see the temporary restart button to know how to do this)
- (2) Add a field that displays the values received from the ultrasonic sensors
- (1) Add a "snow depth" slider or radio buttons. This will be used to control how fast we want the snowblower to move 
- (3) Add a field that displays the cameras point of view on the manual mode and autonomous mode screen. 
- (1) Start work on the mapping mode screen. It should consist of the movement buttons, a "Start Mapping" button, a "End Mapping" button, and a "Set Current Location as Home" button.
- (1) Add an "Emergency Stop" button that is persistant (as in it is always in view). This could be put in the title bar on the right or left side
